# My Life Choice



I have been learning competitive programing since I was in grade 7, selected by the school team. My heart was touched by the logic of algorithms. I was immersed in it. 

But things changed. The situation didn't last long. Studying programing became not as interesting for me as before. Bad news came out one after another.
